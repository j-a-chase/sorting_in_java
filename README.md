# Overview

I designed this program to practice my skills in the Java language! I took the time to go through W3Schools and learn the language, and afterward wanted to do a simple project to apply some of the things that I'd learned! I've been doing a lot with sorting algorithms lately, so I decided to create a program that would compare the time efficiency between them.

This program creates a menu that allows you to specify the size of the randomly generated array you'd like to have. Once that is determined, you then pick which sorting algorithm you'd like to use. The program then times the algorithm in milliseconds and outputs the result to the user.

This software helped me become more familiar with the Java language, as well as with the common sorting algorithms that I have worked with.

# Development Environment

I used Java version 21.0.2 in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

# Future Work

- Add more complex sorting algorithms
- Add ability to sort your own arrays
- Provide more side-to-side tests for easier comparisons than sequential execution of the program
